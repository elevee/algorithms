//Two Sum

/*RULES:
  Function takes two arguments
    An array of numbers
    A 'sum' number that we want
  The function should return an array of pairs from inside the number array, that add up to the sum provided
  
  It's okay for numbers to be used multiple times
  Different ways to solve:
    Nested Loops O(n^2)
    Hash Table O(n)
  Try to solve for both!
