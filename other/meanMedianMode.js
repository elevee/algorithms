// Mean Median Mode

/*RULES:
  Function takes number array as parameter and it will return an object that has three properties:
    Mean - The Average of all numbers
    Median - The middle number
    Mode - The number most seen
  This algorithm should have 4 separate functions:
    getMean(arr)
    getMedian(arr)
    getMode(arr)
    meanMedianMode(arr)
      This last one calls all of the other functions
      Returns an object that has the mean, median, and mode
